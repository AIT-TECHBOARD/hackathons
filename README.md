## Contribution Guidelines
> Stray Pull Requests are not accepted. Before you start working on the project, discuss the needed changes with the owners of the repository. You can ask the owners to assign you [existing issues](https://github.com/AIT-TECHBOARD/hackathons/issues) or raise new issues and wait for acceptance. Don't forget to star the repository.

### Contribution Process
* Make sure you have checked the [existing website](https://ait-techboard.github.io/hackathons/) thoroughly before making any changes.
* Comment on the [issues](https://github.com/AIT-TECHBOARD/hackathons/issues) to get assigned. If you don't find an issue aligned with your purpose, you can create a [new issue](https://github.com/AIT-TECHBOARD/hackathons/issues/new) and wait for the reply of the owners.
* After getting assigned to a particular issue, fork and clone the project on your local machine and start working on the project.
* Update the [README.md file](https://github.com/AIT-TECHBOARD/hackathons/blob/master/README.md) with details of your contributions.
* Associate each Pull Request with the required issue number (mentioned at the side of every issue).
* Always describe the changes you are making before sending the pull requests.

### Contribution Practices
- Please be respectful towards other contributors, do not comment on anyone's caste, gender, etc.
- If a person is working or has been assigned an issue and you want to work on it please ask the assignee if he/she is working on it or if he/she wants to work together (only if the issue is big and could need another set of hands).
- We are happy to allow you to work on your issues, but in case of long period of inactivity the issue will be assigned to another volunteer.
- If you report a bug, please provide steps to reproduce the bug in a new issue.
- If there is a UI related change, it would be great if you could attach a screenshot of the proposed changes so it is easier to get a quick review by the owner.
- If the issue is too big to complete in given time frame, ask for the extension (the owner might/might not approve the extension after reviewing its need).
- Good luck! If you get stuck anywhere, ask for help but do not give up.
